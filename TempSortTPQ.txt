1. What things might cause your new sort template to fail to instantiate?

Lot's of things, mainly bad syntax with the instantiation.


2. Where should the overloaded swap form go? 
(In the library or the main application?) 
If in the library, should it be in the header
 with the swap template or in the implementation file? 
Does it matter to the compiler where it is? Why/Why not?

I'm keeping in the main app, having templates in 
header files is nasty business and requires alot of 
time and effort to do, which I'm not gonna do 
on a lab worth only 2 levels


3. Did you need to make any changes to your original swap template?

Yes, I made it so it takes in functions for the comparisons.


4. Which comparisons did you write as plain functions?
Function objects? Were any of them templated?
Could/Should they have been? 
(Hint: you should use at least one plain function 
and one function object class to show you can do both.)

None of the comparisons there plain functions, but I 
could use them if I wanted to, all of them are 
templated function objects passed through to the sort
function
